# **Here i1ll be posting my JS progress**

- Some files might be in portuguese because i'm too lazy to change it, and whatever, it is just a way of tracking my progress.
- Don't expect anything brilliant here, it's just a new dev doing new dev stuff. 
- On the file "ProgramacaoPObjetos", for some reason that i don't know why, my package.json wasn't working the way it was supposed to, so i let the codes that depended on it as comments.
